# Repository Hygiene

## When This Applies
- After creating, deleting, or moving files
- When working sessions get long (10+ tool calls)
- Before final commit of a feature

## File Organization

### Never commit to root unless it's:
- README.md
- LICENSE
- .gitignore
- Config files (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.)

### Temporary/generated files go in .gitignore:
- Extracted data (*_messages.json, *_export.json)
- Generated outputs (*_cursorrules.md, *_analysis.md)
- Build artifacts (__pycache__, node_modules/, dist/, *.egg-info)
- IDE configs (.cursor/, .idea/, .vscode/)

### If you create a file, ask: "Does this belong in git?"
- Scripts for personal use → don't commit, add to .gitignore
- API keys or secrets → NEVER commit, add to .gitignore immediately
- One-off analysis → don't commit unless explicitly requested

## Cleanup Triggers

### After deleting a feature/page:
- Check for orphaned files (empty folders, unused components)
- Remove related API routes, lib files, types
- Update any imports that referenced deleted code

### After a long session:
- Run `git status` to see what's accumulated
- Question any untracked files at root level
- Suggest cleanup if clutter is building up

## Folder Structure

Keep related things together:
```
project/
├── src/           ← All source code
├── tests/         ← All tests
├── docs/          ← Documentation (if needed)
├── scripts/       ← Utility scripts (if needed)
└── [config files] ← Root level only for configs
```

Don't create folders unless there are 3+ related files to put in them.

## Before Pushing

Ask yourself:
1. Are there any files at root that shouldn't be?
2. Did I add new file types that should be in .gitignore?
3. Are there empty directories from deleted code?
4. Would a new developer understand this structure?
